# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive educational book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book covers the complete end-to-end robotics pipeline from middleware to perception to action, with a focus on modern approaches using ROS 2, simulation environments, AI perception systems, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Computer Science students
- AI/Robotics engineering students
- Researchers interested in humanoid robotics
- Developers working on robotics applications

## Book Structure

The book is organized into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1 - ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Learn about the robotic nervous system with ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, rclpy Python integration, and URDF for humanoid robots.

2. **Module 2 - Digital Twin**: Explore simulation with Gazebo physics, sensor simulation, and Unity rendering for high-fidelity interaction.

3. **Module 3 - AI-Robot Brain**: Understand perception systems with NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS pipelines, and Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement.

4. **Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Discover voice-to-action systems with Whisper, cognitive planning with LLMs, and autonomous humanoid pipelines.

## Interactive Features

This book includes several interactive features to enhance your learning experience:

- **RAG Chatbot**: Ask questions about the book content and get answers based strictly on the book's content
- **Language Toggle**: Switch between English and Urdu for better accessibility
- **User Authentication**: Sign up to track your learning progress

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this book, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of ROS 2 and its role in humanoid robotics
- Know how to create and work with simulation environments
- Grasp perception and navigation concepts for AI-powered robots
- Be familiar with VLA systems and their implementation

## Prerequisites

This book assumes you have:
