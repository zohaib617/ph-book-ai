# ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services

## Introduction

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the nervous system for robotic applications, providing a framework for communication between different software components. This chapter introduces the fundamental communication patterns in ROS 2: Nodes, Topics, and Services.

## Nodes

A node is a process that performs computation. In ROS 2, nodes are designed to be modular and focused on a single task. Nodes communicate with each other using:

- Topics for asynchronous, many-to-many communication
- Services for synchronous, request-response communication
- Actions for goal-oriented communication with feedback

### Creating a Node

In ROS 2, nodes are typically created by inheriting from the `rclpy.Node` class:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MyNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('my_node_name')
        # Node initialization code here

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = MyNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()
```

## Topics

Topics enable asynchronous communication through a publish-subscribe model. Publishers send messages to a topic, and subscribers receive messages from that topic. This decouples the timing of publishers and subscribers.

### Publisher Example

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class PublisherNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('publisher_node')
        self.publisher = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic_name', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World'
        self.publisher.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
```

### Subscriber Example

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class SubscriberNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('subscriber_node')
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            String,
            'topic_name',
            self.listener_callback,
            10)
        self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        self.get_logger().info('I heard: "%s"' % msg.data)
```

## Services

Services provide synchronous request-response communication. A client sends a request to a service server, which processes the request and returns a response.

### Service Server Example

```python
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalService(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_service')
        self.srv = self.create_service(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints', self.add_two_ints_callback)

    def add_two_ints_callback(self, request, response):
        response.sum = request.a + request.b
        self.get_logger().info('Incoming request\na: %d b: %d' % (request.a, request.b))
        return response
```

### Service Client Example

```python
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalClientAsync(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_client_async')
        self.cli = self.create_client(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints')
        while not self.cli.wait_for_service(timeout_sec=1.0):
            self.get_logger().info('service not available, waiting again...')
        self.req = AddTwoInts.Request()

    def send_request(self, a, b):
        self.req.a = a
        self.req.b = b
        self.future = self.cli.call_async(self.req)
        rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, self.future)
        return self.future.result()
```

## Quality of Service (QoS)

ROS 2 provides Quality of Service settings to control the communication behavior between publishers and subscribers:

- Reliability: Best effort or reliable delivery
- Durability: Volatile or transient local
- History: Keep all or keep last N messages
- Depth: Size of the message queue

## Best Practices

- Keep nodes focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive names for topics, services, and nodes
- Implement proper error handling
- Use appropriate QoS settings for your application
- Separate concerns between different nodes

## RAG Summary

ROS 2 provides the communication framework for robotic applications through Nodes (computational processes), Topics (publish-subscribe communication), and Services (request-response communication). Nodes are modular components that communicate asynchronously via topics or synchronously via services. Quality of Service settings control communication behavior to meet specific application requirements.

## Knowledge Check

1. What is the difference between a publisher and a subscriber in ROS 2?
2. When would you use a service instead of a topic?
3. What are Quality of Service settings and why are they important?
