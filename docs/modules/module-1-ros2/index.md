# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module covers the foundational concepts of ROS 2, which serves as the robotic nervous system for humanoid robots.

## Overview

This module introduces you to:
- ROS 2 communication patterns (Nodes, Topics, Services)
- Python integration with rclpy for AI agents
- Robot modeling with URDF for humanoid robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the fundamental communication mechanisms in ROS 2
- Be able to create Python-based ROS 2 nodes for AI agents
- Know how to describe humanoid robots using URDF

## Chapters

1. [ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services](./01-nodes-topics-services.mdx) - Introduction to ROS 2 communication patterns
2. [rclpy: Bridging Python Agents to ROS 2](./02-rclpy-python-agent.mdx) - Python integration with ROS 2
3. [URDF Basics for Humanoid Robots](./03-urdf-humanoid.mdx) - Robot description format for humanoid models

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Knowledge of Linux command line (helpful but not required)

## RAG Summary

Module 1 covers the ROS 2 fundamentals essential for humanoid robotics, including communication patterns, Python integration, and robot description. These concepts form the foundation for building complex humanoid robotic systems with proper communication, AI integration, and robot modeling.

## Next Steps

After completing this module, continue to Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) to learn about simulation environments for humanoid robots.
